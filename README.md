First working version of my homework.
Refactoring is still needed, and some bugfixes.

I will work on it for more.

//TODOs:

rename account
change password
delete account

BigDecimal instead of doubles
Bank as embedded object, use Domain object's relations when working with requests and transactions
Refactoring
Services check account status, to avoid concurrency problems
Username @Column(unique=true) -> Foglalt felhasználónév esetén hiba
Unit tests
